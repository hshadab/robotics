# Verifiable AI for Robotics — zkML Guard Demo

**Live Demo:** http://localhost:9200 (when running)
**GitHub:** https://github.com/hshadab/robotics
**Tech Stack:** ROS 2 + JOLT-Atlas zkML + ONNX Runtime + Node.js

---

## Executive Summary

We've built a working demonstration of **cryptographically verifiable robotics** using zero-knowledge machine learning (zkML). This system proves that a robot's AI decisions were made using a specific, certified model—without exposing the model itself or requiring trust in the operator.

**Key Innovation:** Every robot motion command requires a cryptographic proof that the correct ML model was used for the decision. If someone tampers with the model, proofs fail and motion is blocked—**demonstrably and automatically**.

**Why This Matters:** As robotics moves into high-stakes environments (autonomous vehicles, medical robots, warehouses, public spaces), there's no reliable way to verify that a robot is using approved software. Our system provides cryptographic guarantees that are independently verifiable without trusting the robot operator.

```

### Technical Flow

1. **Camera publishes images** at 30 Hz via ROS 2 (`/image` topic)

2. **zkML Guard node** samples frames and runs ML inference:
   - Uses MobileNetV2 ONNX model (14MB, 1000 ImageNet classes)
   - 10ms inference time on CPU
   - Computes SHA256 hash of both model file and input tensor

3. **Proof triggering** when confidence threshold exceeded:
   - Guard sends model + preprocessed input to JOLT-Atlas verifier
   - Verifier generates zero-knowledge proof (3-4 seconds)
   - Proof cryptographically binds to exact model hash + input hash

4. **Verification and gating**:
   - JOLT verifier confirms proof validity
   - Guard publishes unlock signal (`/zkml/stop = false`)
   - twist_mux releases motion commands for 10 seconds
   - After timeout, motion locks again until next proof

5. **Tampering detection** (NEW):
   - Guard stores original model hash at startup
   - Before each proof, checks if model file was modified
   - If hash mismatch detected, proof generation blocked
   - Motion stays locked, errors logged with forensic details

### Live Demo Features

**Web UI (http://localhost:9200):**
- Real-time camera feed with ML detection overlay
- Visual proof pipeline showing inference → proof → verification states
- Motion gating countdown timer (shows seconds until re-lock)
- Verified proofs history with snapshot thumbnails
- **"Flip to Tampered Model"** button to demonstrate security

**Demo Workflow:**
```bash
# Start the demo
./start_demo.sh

# In browser: Watch proofs generate and motion unlock

# Click "Flip to Tampered Model"
→ Model file modified (3 bytes flipped in middle)
→ Next proof attempt: "MODEL TAMPERING DETECTED!"
→ Motion stays locked (red)
→ Error log shows: Expected: c0c3f76d... | Actual: b9cacfef...

# Click "Restore Original Model"
→ Proofs work normally again
```

### Integration Points

**1. Middleware Integration (ROS 2)**
- zkML Guard is a standard ROS 2 node (Python/rclpy)
- Subscribes to existing topics (`/image`, `/cmd_vel`)
- Publishes verification signals (`/zkml/stop`, `/zkml/event`)
- Works with twist_mux for safety enforcement
- Compatible with existing ROS 2 tooling (rviz, Foxglove, rosbag)

**2. ML Pipeline Integration**
- Accepts any ONNX model (not locked to MobileNetV2)
- Works with existing inference engines (ONNX Runtime, TensorRT)
- Preprocessing stays in your existing perception stack
- Proof generation happens asynchronously (doesn't block inference)

**3. Safety System Integration**
- Acts as additional verification layer, not replacement
- Fails safe: motion locks if proof fails or times out
- Integrates with existing safety controllers (e.g., twist_mux)
- Provides audit trail via `/zkml/event` topic (record to MCAP)

**4. Fleet Management Integration**
- HTTP API for remote monitoring (GET /status, /api/last_event)
- Server-Sent Events stream for real-time updates
- JSON audit logs with cryptographic proof IDs
- Compatible with existing fleet dashboards

### Deployment Scenarios

**Edge Computing:**
```
Robot (Jetson/Pi) → Runs inference + proof generation locally
                  → Publishes proofs to fleet manager
                  → Fleet manager verifies proofs remotely
```

**Cloud-Assisted:**
```
Robot → Runs inference locally (10ms)
      → Sends proof request to cloud verifier (3-4s)
      → Caches verification result for timeout window
      → Continues operation with proof chain
```

**Multi-Party Verification:**
```
Warehouse Owner → Wants proof contractor used approved models
Contractor Ops  → Generates proofs during operation
Insurance Co.   → Verifies proofs independently without robot access
Regulator       → Audits proof chain from MCAP recordings
```

## Value Proposition

### Problem Space: Trust Crisis in Robotics

As robots move from controlled labs into the real world, we face a **fundamental trust problem**:

**Scenario 1: Autonomous Delivery Robots**
- Fleet operates in public spaces
- Software updates pushed remotely
- **Risk:** Malicious update changes safety thresholds
- **Impact:** 10,000 robots suddenly ignore pedestrians
- **Current solution:** None. Trust the operator or inspect each robot.

**Scenario 2: Medical Robotics**
- Surgical robot uses AI for tissue classification
- FDA approved Model v2.1 specifically
- **Risk:** Hospital loads older Model v1.8 (cheaper licensing)
- **Impact:** Wrong tissue classified, patient harm
- **Current solution:** Manual audits. Slow, expensive, not real-time.

**Scenario 3: Warehouse Automation**
- Contractor operates robots in your facility
- Contract specifies safety-certified models only
- **Risk:** Contractor substitutes faster but uncertified model
- **Impact:** Accident → Liability question: "Which model was running?"
- **Current solution:** Trust contract. No verification capability.

### Solution: Cryptographic Verification

**What zkML Provides:**

1. **Computational Integrity**
   - Proves the **exact model** (by SHA256 hash) was used
   - Proves the **exact input** (by SHA256 hash) was processed
   - Creates unforgeable audit trail of every decision

2. **Trustless Operation**
   - Third parties can verify without accessing robot
   - No need to trust operator, software vendor, or cloud provider
   - Independent verification using public cryptographic proof

3. **Real-Time Enforcement**
   - Not just audit—active enforcement during operation
   - Model tampering immediately blocks motion
   - Fail-safe: proof failure = motion lock

4. **Regulatory Compliance**
   - Cryptographic proof that certified model was used
   - Audit trail for liability investigations
   - Works with existing safety certifications (adds verification layer)

### Market Opportunity

**Immediate Applications:**

1. **Autonomous Vehicles** ($1.3T market by 2030)
   - Prove OTA updates didn't disable safety features
   - Verify certified perception models during operation
   - Liability protection: "Our model was provably running correctly"

2. **Industrial Robotics** ($74B market by 2030)
   - Multi-vendor environments (trust between companies)
   - Contractor operations in customer facilities
   - Safety compliance verification

3. **Medical Robotics** ($27B market by 2028)
   - FDA compliance: prove approved model version used
   - Liability protection for hospitals and manufacturers
   - Patient safety: detect unauthorized modifications

4. **Defense & Critical Infrastructure** ($180B market)
   - Supply chain security: verify no backdoors in ML models
   - Mission-critical operations require proof of software integrity
   - Zero-trust environments

**Business Models:**

- **Software licensing:** Per-robot or per-fleet pricing
- **Verification as a Service:** Cloud API for proof verification
- **Audit & Compliance:** Proof chain analysis for insurers/regulators
- **Insurance discounts:** Lower premiums for verifiable fleets

- Verification: <1 second
- Motion unlocked for 10 seconds after proof → robot continues operating

**2. Practical Integration**
- ROS 2 native (works with existing robotics stack)
- ONNX model support (most frameworks export to ONNX)
- HTTP API for non-ROS systems
- No custom hardware required

**3. Cryptographic Guarantees**
- 128-bit security (JOLT-Atlas, BN254 curve)
- Dory polynomial commitments (modern zkSNARK)
- SHA256 binding prevents substitution attacks
- Verifiable by any third party with proof data

**4. Extensible Design**
- Not locked to vision models (works with any ONNX)
- Configurable gating modes (argmax, threshold, custom)
- Plugin architecture for different proof systems
- Scales from single robot to fleet

### Current Limitations & Roadmap

**Limitations:**
- **Proof time:** 3-4 seconds too slow for real-time control loops
  - *Solution:* Proof caching, periodic re-verification, faster proof systems
- **Proof scope:** Currently proves sentinel model, not full MobileNetV2
  - *Why:* Full model proof takes 30 minutes to 2 hours
  - *Roadmap:* GPU prover acceleration, model compression, recursive proofs
- **Energy cost:** Proof generation ~10-20W for 3-4 seconds
  - *Solution:* Adaptive proving (only on state changes), edge accelerators

**Near-Term Roadmap:**
- [ ] GPU prover support (10-100x speedup)
- [ ] Proof caching and reuse
- [ ] Multi-model verification (sensor fusion)
- [ ] Fleet-level verification dashboard
- [ ] Integration with ROS 2 Security (DDS encryption)

## Why Now?

**Convergence of Three Trends:**

1. **Robotics Deployment at Scale**
   - Autonomous vehicles entering public roads
   - Warehouse robots in every Amazon facility
   - Delivery robots in cities worldwide
   - **Problem:** Trust doesn't scale. Manual audits don't scale.

2. **AI Regulation Incoming**
   - EU AI Act requires "high-risk AI systems" verification
   - FDA increasing scrutiny of ML-based medical devices
   - Insurance industry demanding software audit trails
   - **Gap:** No technology exists to verify AI in production

3. **zkML Technology Mature**
   - JOLT-Atlas proving system production-ready (a16z crypto)
   - Proof times practical for robotics (3-4 seconds)
   - Hardware acceleration available (GPU provers)
   - **Timing:** Early enough to set standards, late enough to work

## Appendix: Technical Deep Dive

### zkML Primer for Robotics

**What is zkML?**
- Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning = Cryptographic proofs for ML computations
- Proves "I ran model M on input I and got output O" without revealing M or I
- Based on zkSNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge)

**How JOLT-Atlas Works:**
1. ML model compiled to execution trace (11 steps for sentinel model)
2. Trace converted to polynomial equations
3. Prover generates commitment to polynomials (Dory scheme)
4. Verifier checks commitments match claimed computation
5. Verification ~1000x faster than re-execution

**Why Not Just Run Model Twice?**
- Tampering happens at file level, not runtime
- Re-running tampered model gives same (wrong) answer
- zkML cryptographically binds to original model hash
- Third parties can verify without robot access

### ONNX Model Format

**Why ONNX?**
- Universal format (exports from PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX, etc.)
- Optimized runtime (ONNX Runtime beats native in many cases)
- Hardware acceleration (CPU, GPU, NPU)
- Industry standard for deployment

**Supported Models:**
- Vision: ResNet, EfficientNet, YOLO, SAM
- NLP: BERT, GPT, T5 (smaller variants)
- Audio: Whisper, Wav2Vec
- Any model exportable to ONNX format

### ROS 2 Integration Details

**Topics:**
```
/image (sensor_msgs/Image)
  → Camera feed, 30 Hz, 640×480 or 1920×1080

/zkml/event (std_msgs/String - JSON)
  → Proof metadata: model hash, input hash, result, timing
  → Example:
    {
      "ts": 1760501733.95,
      "model_sha256": "c0c3f76d93fa3fd6...",
      "input_sha256": "bb92837d3c2a8f1e...",
      "top1_label": "coffee_mug",
      "top1_score": 0.576,
      "proof_verified": true,
      "proof_ms": 3847,
      "proof_id": "0x1a2b3c4d..."
    }

/zkml/stop (std_msgs/Bool)
  → Motion lock signal
  → true = locked, false = unlocked

/cmd_vel (geometry_msgs/Twist)
  → Velocity commands from teleop/planner

/cmd_vel_out (geometry_msgs/Twist)
  → Gated velocity commands to robot
  → twist_mux blocks if /zkml/stop = true
```

**Parameters:**
```yaml
verifier_mode: "http"  # or "cli"
verifier_url: "http://localhost:9100/verify"
threshold: 0.6  # Min confidence to trigger proof
gating_mode: "argmax"  # or "threshold"
prove_on: "rising_edge"  # or "every_pass"
unlock_hold_ms: 10000  # Keep unlocked for 10s after proof
require_proof: true  # Enforce proof verification
```

### Proof Chain Example

```json
{
  "event_sequence": [
    {
      "ts": 1760501730.12,
      "model_sha256": "c0c3f76d...",
      "input_sha256": "a1b2c3d4...",
      "top1_label": "coffee_mug",
      "top1_score": 0.45,
      "predicate_met": false,
      "proof_verified": null,
      "motion_locked": true
    },
    {
      "ts": 1760501733.95,
      "model_sha256": "c0c3f76d...",
      "input_sha256": "bb92837d...",
      "top1_label": "coffee_mug",
      "top1_score": 0.576,
      "predicate_met": true,
      "proof_verified": true,
      "proof_ms": 3847,
      "proof_id": "0x1a2b3c4d5e6f...",
      "verified_until": 1760501743.95,
      "motion_locked": false
    },
    {
      "ts": 1760501744.50,
      "model_sha256": "c0c3f76d...",
      "input_sha256": "f8e7d6c5...",
      "top1_label": "water_bottle",
      "top1_score": 0.62,
      "predicate_met": true,
      "proof_verified": null,
      "motion_locked": true,
      "reason": "unlock window expired, new proof required"
    }
  ]
}
```

Each event is:
- **Timestamped** (Unix epoch, microsecond precision)
- **Cryptographically bound** (SHA256 hashes)
- **Auditable** (recorded to MCAP)
- **Verifiable** (third parties can check proof_id)
