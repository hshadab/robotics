# UI Enhancements for zkML Robotics Demo

## New Enhanced UI: `demo.html`

Access at: **http://localhost:9200/demo.html**

## What's New (All Real Data!)

### 1. **Live Metrics Dashboard** üìä
Four real-time counters at the top:
- **Frames Processed**: Actual count from camera feed
- **Proofs Generated**: Real ZK proofs created
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of verified proofs
- **Average Proof Time**: Mean time in milliseconds

**Data Source**: All from real `/zkml/event` messages

### 2. **Enhanced Camera Feed** üìπ
- **Live FPS Counter**: Shows actual frame rate
- **Detection Overlay**: Current top prediction with confidence
- **Larger Display**: Better visibility
- **Real-time Updates**: 10 FPS refresh

**What's Real**:
- Camera feed from actual ROS `/image` topic
- Detection labels from MobileNetV2 model
- Confidence scores from softmax output

### 3. **Proof Pipeline Visualization** ‚ö°
Three-step animated pipeline:

**Step 1: ML Inference**
- Status: Complete/Active/Waiting
- Shows: Model filename
- Real data: Actual ONNX model path

**Step 2: Proof Generation** üîê
- Status: Active (with pulse animation) when generating
- Shows: Proof generation time in milliseconds
- Shows: Proof ID (first 16 chars of hash)
- Real data: Actual JOLT proof computation time

**Step 3: Verification** ‚úì
- Status: Complete (green) or Failed (red)
- Shows: Verification result
- Real data: Cryptographic verification from JOLT

**Visual Feedback**:
- Glowing borders when active
- Pulse animation during proof generation
- Green checkmarks on success
- All transitions match actual proof lifecycle

### 4. **Top Predictions Confidence Bars** üìà
- **Horizontal bar charts** for top 5 classes
- **Animated bars** that fill based on confidence
- **Percentage labels** inside bars
- **Color gradient** from accent to green

**Current State**: Shows top-1 + mock data for demo
**Easy to Enhance**: Can show real top-5 from model logits array

### 5. **Proof Explorer** üîç
Interactive proof details panel showing:

**Real Cryptographic Data**:
- **Model SHA-256**: Hash of ONNX file (proves model identity)
- **Input SHA-256**: Hash of preprocessed tensor (proves exact input)
- **Top Prediction**: Class name + ID
- **Confidence**: Actual softmax probability
- **Proof Verified**: Boolean verification result
- **Proof Time**: Generation time in ms
- **Proof ID**: Unique proof identifier
- **Timestamp**: When proof was created

**Downloadable**: Click "Download JSON" to save full proof

**Why This Matters**:
- Shows users the **actual cryptographic commitments**
- Proves the ML inference really happened
- All hashes are real SHA-256 values
- Can be independently verified

### 6. **Live Event Log** üìù
- **Real-time stream** of detection events
- **Color-coded**: Green for verified, amber for failed
- **Scrolling feed**: Latest 50 events
- **Timestamps**: Exact time of each detection

### 7. **Professional Design** ‚ú®
- **Dark theme**: Cybersecurity aesthetic
- **JetBrains Mono**: Monospace font for code/hashes
- **Smooth animations**: Proof pipeline transitions
- **Glowing effects**: Active states pulse
- **Responsive layout**: Works on different screen sizes

## What's Real vs. What Could Be Enhanced

### ‚úÖ Currently Real
1. Camera feed (from ROS `/image` topic)
2. ML model (MobileNetV2 ONNX)
3. Detection labels (ImageNet classes)
4. Confidence scores (softmax probabilities)
5. Model SHA-256 (actual hash of ONNX file)
6. Input SHA-256 (actual hash of preprocessed tensor)
7. Proof verification status (real JOLT proofs)
8. Proof generation time (real milliseconds)
9. Proof IDs (actual proof hashes)
10. All timestamps (real time)

### üîß Could Be Enhanced (Easy Additions)
1. **Top-5 Predictions**: Currently shows top-1 + mock data
   - **Fix**: Parse `logits` array from event, get top 5 indices
   - **Why mock for now**: Current event doesn't send full logits (only top-1)
   - **How to make real**: Add top-5 IDs to `/zkml/event` payload

2. **Bounding Boxes**: No object detection yet
   - **Current**: Classification only (whole image)
   - **To add**: Would need object detection model (YOLO, etc.)

3. **Live Proof Progress**: Currently shows completed/waiting
   - **Could add**: WebSocket for real-time "35% complete" updates
   - **Current**: Only see start/end states

## How Everything Works (Data Flow)

```

## Proof Verification (This is REAL)

When UI shows "‚úì Proof Verified":

1. **zkml_guard** generated a JOLT proof that:
   - Input tensor SHA: `8c52c87bcb57f657...`
   - Model SHA: `7cbad1d83c2dbeb0...`
   - Output argmax: Class 573 ("go-kart")

2. **JOLT verifier** cryptographically verified:
   - The proof is valid
   - The computation was correct
   - No tampering occurred

3. **UI shows**:
   - All hashes (real SHA-256)
   - Proof time (real milliseconds)
   - Verification status (real cryptography)

## Making It More Impressive (Suggestions)

### Option 1: Add Real Top-5 Predictions
**Change needed**: Modify `zkml_guard_node.py` to include top-5 in event:

```python
# In publish_event()
top5_ids = np.argsort(probs)[-5:][::-1]
top5_scores = probs[top5_ids]
event['top5_ids'] = top5_ids.tolist()
event['top5_scores'] = top5_scores.tolist()
event['top5_labels'] = [self.labels[i] for i in top5_ids]
```

Then UI will show **real** top-5 confidence bars!

### Option 2: Add Proof Statistics Over Time
- Chart showing proof times over last 100 proofs
- Success rate trending
- Would need to store historical data

### Option 3: Add Model Explainability
- Show which image regions influenced the decision
- Requires GradCAM or attention maps
- More advanced ML feature

### Option 4: Add "Challenge" Mode
- User uploads their own image
- System proves what it detects
- User can verify proof independently
- Great for interactive demos!
